## Implementation of different algorithm such as:


#### <span style="color:Blue"> Newton, BFGS and gradient descendent


## Implementation of multiobjetvice optimization algoritms

#### <span style="color:Blue"> Electre:

For given matrix

#### <span style="color:Blue"> TOPSIS:

For this one I calculated $TOPSIS$ for $p=1,2\ and\ \infty$

## <span style="color:Blue"> NSGA II

This source code is from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/65494-non-sorting-genetic-algorithm-ii-nsga-ii
each line is explain in Spanish, and there are some modifications and there is a file ProblemaNSGA2.m where an optimization problem is proposed and is solved by using
NSGA II implentaion given
